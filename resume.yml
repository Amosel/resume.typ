      Amos and I worked together at Mediabrix. He created the SDK that I had
      game teams integrate. There are many types of engineers that can do this work,
      but Amos is the best, because his work is like art. His attention to detail and
      determination to make things perfect only made my job easier. He is one of the
      rare engineers that I have worked with that works with you in the trenches to
      deliver the right thing at the right time, right now. Not only that but he is
      also a great dinner companion and has such a passion for life and friendship it
      makes you glad to be on the planet with him.

      Amos is sharp, dedicated, professional and great with getting things
      done. My students find his ideas fresh and inspiring, admire his knowledge and
      experience and produce great value from his simple and practical solutions. Although
      having no formal Computer Engineering education, his teaching defiantly show his
      hard gained garage crafts.
